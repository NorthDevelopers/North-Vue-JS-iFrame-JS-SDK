# Securely Embed Payments in a VueJS App

This is a JavaScript application that uses the front-end Vue framework to demonstrate an embedded payment solution with [North's iFrame JavaScript SDK](https://developer.north.com/products/online/iframe-javascript-sdk). The code in this repository handles the front-end payment process and adds a simple payment form to a website. The code that handles back-end part of the payment process is located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/NorthDevelopers/North-NodeJS-iFrame-JS-SDK), allowing each to be deployed separately.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [North Developer account](https://developer.north.com/register). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. View the official [iFrame JavaScript SDK Integration Guide](https://developer.north.com/products/online/iframe-javascript-sdk/integration-guide), then [contact](https://developer.north.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your North Developer account.
